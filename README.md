Google Classroom Assignment Tracker
This Google Apps Script is designed to help teachers and administrators easily track which students have completed or are missing assignments across multiple Google Classrooms. The script retrieves assignment and submission data and organizes it into a Google Sheet for clear and actionable insights.

Features
Track Completion Status: Displays whether each student has completed or missed assignments.
Multi-Classroom Support: Works across all Google Classrooms linked to your account.
Organized Output: Data is presented in a Google Sheet with headers: Student Name, Class Name, Assignment Name, and Status.
Automated Updates: Set up an optional hourly trigger for continuous updates.
Customizable Filtering: Easily modify the script to focus on specific students or track all students by default.
